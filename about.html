<p><h4>Hi There! My name is Fernando. I've been working with data and business analysis for more than 5 years. After finishing my B.S in Economics I went from MS Excel nerd to
working daily using Python, SQL and a touch of statistics.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Recently, in my spare time, I have been enjoying myself creating web projects and learning new technologies ;).</h4></p>


<p><h4 class="about-ps">PS: I just moved to Edmonton, Alberta, and I am looking for opportuninities here as a data analyst (normal job and volunteering colab projects). If you happen to know something , please, send an e-mail (fmera.filho@gmail.com). Thanks!</h4> </p>
